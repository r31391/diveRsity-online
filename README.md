diveRsity GUI web app, designed using shiny from RStudio and Inc.

To run the app, download the zip or tar, extract and in R use the following code:


```R
library("shiny") # you will have to have downloaded and installed the shiny package
runApp("Path/to/extracted/files/") # substitute the correct path to downloaded files
```

An example of the apps capabilities can be see at http://glimmer.rstudio.com/kkeenan/diveRsity-online/
